# EcommerceSegmenatation
Customer segmentation analysis on an e-commerce dataset using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis and KMeans clustering. This project identifies high-value customers and visualizes customer segments with interactive plots.

## ðŸ“Œ Objective

E-commerce businesses need to understand customer behavior to improve retention and sales. This notebook:

- Segments customers based on purchasing behavior  
- Identifies high-value and loyal customers  
- Visualizes customer clusters for easy interpretation

  - Handles missing values and cancelled orders  
  - Computes total transaction value per order  

- **RFM Feature Engineering**  
  - Recency: Days since last purchase  
  - Frequency: Total number of purchases  
  - Monetary: Total spending  

- **KMeans Clustering**  
  - Groups customers into meaningful segments  
  - Cluster labels for business interpretation  

- **Visualizations**
